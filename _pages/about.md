I'm currently a junior at the University of Toronto majoring in statistics with minors
in mathematics and economics. I am passionate about applying advanced
statistical methods to real-world business problems

This past summer I was a data science intern at IQVIA in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
I analyzed multi billion record prescription drug datasets and built a classification
model to predict which healthcare benefit a claim was run under.

I enjoy participating in datathons, and have received awards at
two of the three datathons that I have participated in.

In my free time, I love to travel and explore new cultures, especially using frequent flyer miles.
Some of my most treasured memories have been snorkeling in the great barrier reef,
exploring markets in Bangkok, and having the world's cheapest Michelin starred food in Hong Kong.
