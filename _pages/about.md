I'm currently a senior at the University of Toronto majoring in statistics with minors
in mathematics and economics. I am especially interested in causal inference, experimental design, machine learning, and bayesian statistics.   

This past summer, I was a data science intern at Aetna in New York City. I worked on improving patient health through predictive modeling and behavior change.

Last summer, I was a data science intern at IQVIA in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
I analyzed multi billion record prescription drug datasets and built a classification
model to predict which healthcare benefit a prescription drug claim was run under.

I enjoy participating in datathons, and have received awards at
two of the three datathons that I have participated in.

In my free time, I love to travel and explore new cultures, especially using frequent flyer miles.
Some of my most treasured memories have been snorkeling in the great barrier reef,
exploring markets in Bangkok, and having the world's cheapest Michelin starred food in Hong Kong.
