Today I am excited to announce my first ever series on my blog called Models from
Scratch. This will be a multi-part series where I go through several popular
machine learning algorithms and code them from scratch in Python.

## Motivation

Machine learning is an incredibly valuable tool in a Data Scientist's toolkit. With the advent of
packages for every single machine learning algorithm it is very easy to lose sight of
what is being done "under the hood". Running an ML model can be done with just a few
lines of code without really understanding the math behind the package.

In this series I am going to be sharpening my theoretical knowledge of ML algorithms by translating the mathematics of the algorithms
into code. The code won't be optimized for large datasets, because the goal of the code is to help understand the theoretical aspects of the model.

## Overview

Each blog post will cover a different machine learning model and walk through
the math and the corresponding python code.

## Potential posts

I am hoping to cover a wide spectrum of both supervised and unsupervised learning
models in the series. This will be a multi month long series

### Supervised learning
1. Linear Regression
2. Penalized Regression: Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Tree Based Methods: Desicsion Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Machines

### Unsupervised Learning
1. k-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. PCA

## Feedback

As a young data scientist it is important to continously be learning. Please
comment down below any advice or suggestions that you have. I may make mistakes along the way
and I appreciate all constructive feedback. If you don't feel comforatorable commenting on the blog,
feel free to email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
