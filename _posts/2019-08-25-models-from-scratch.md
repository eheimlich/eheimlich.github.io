Today I am excited to announce my first ever series on my blog called Models from
Scratch. This will be a multi-part series where I go through several popular
machine learning algorithms and code them from scratch in Python.

## Motivation

Machine learning is an incredibly valuable tool in a Data Scientist's toolkit. With the advent of
packages for every single machine learning algorithm it is very easy to lose sight of
what is being done "under the hood". Running an ML model can be done with just a few
lines of code without really understanding the math behind the package.

In this series I am going to be sharpening my theoretical knowledge of ML algorithms by translating the mathematics of the algorithms
into code. The code won't be optimized for large datasets, because the goal of the code is to help understand the theoretical aspects of the model.

## Overview

Each blog post will cover a different machine learning model and walk through
the math and the corrosponding python code. I am hoping that this series will be
useful to both aspiring and current data scientists.

## Potential posts

I am hoping to cover a wide spectrum of both supervised and unsupervised learning
models. These are the models I am hoping to get to eventually, but I may or may not
be able to get to everything.

### Supervised learning
1. Linear Regression
2. Penalized Regression: Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Tree Based Methods: Desicsion Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Machines
5. Nueral Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
1. k-Means Clustering
2. Heirichal Clustering
3.
