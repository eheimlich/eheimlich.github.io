Today I am excited to announce my first ever series on my blog called Models from
Scratch. This will be a multi-part series where I go through several popular
machine learning algorithms and code them from scratch in Python.

## Motivation

Machine learning is an incredibly valuable tool in a Data Scientist's toolkit. With the advent of
packages for every single machine learning algorithm it is very easy to lose sight of
what is being done "under the hood". Running an ML model can be done with just a few
lines of code without really understanding the math behind the package.

In this series I am going to be sharpening my theoritical knowledge of ML algorithims by d



## Overview

Each blog post will cover a machine learning model from a theoretical perspective.
For example,
