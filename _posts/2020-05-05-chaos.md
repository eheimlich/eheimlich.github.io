Why do people study mathematics? They spend all day learning these abstract concepts with seemingly little real-world value. However, mathematics is the foundation of so many disciplines from physics, to computer science to the spread of infectious diseases. As COVID-19 is gripping the world, we can use mathematics as a lens to gain some insight into how COVID-19 is spreading. Now it's important to note that this is an incredibly complex question, but we can try to understand it at a high level using a model called the logistic map. Â 

Suppose that epidemiologists have found that if there are $X$ percent of a population infected today with COVID-19, then the percentage of the population infected tomorrow will be:


$$X_{tomorrow} = r  \times X_{today}(1 - X_{today})$$
