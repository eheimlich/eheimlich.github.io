Why do people study mathematics? They spend all day learning these abstract concepts with seemingly little real-world value. However, mathematics is the foundation of so many disciplines from physics, to computer science to the spread of infectious diseases. As COVID-19 is gripping the world, we can use mathematics as a lens to gain some insight into how COVID-19 is spreading. Now it's important to note that this is an incredibly complex question, but we can try to understand it at a high level using a model called the logistic map. Â 

Suppose that epidemiologists have found that if there are $$X$$ percent of a population infected today with COVID-19, then the percentage of the population infected tomorrow will be:


$$X_{tomorrow} = r  \times X_{today}(1 - X_{today})$$

Where $$X_{t}$$ is the percentage of the population that is infected with the disease at a given time t. While $$r$$ is a number between 0 and 4 that describes how many new people an infected person gives the disease to at each time, minus one. For example, early studies have shown that on average an infected person transmits COVID-19 to 2.5 new people, so the $r$ value would be 2.5 - 1 = 1.5. We can visualize the logistic map and its model of COVID-19 spread with a diagram. We start the model with one out of every million people initially being infected. For example, in the United States that would mean approximately 330 people would be infected on day 1.
